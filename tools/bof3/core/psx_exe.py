"""The PS-X EXE header: one reader for every tool that maps a retail image.

Field offsets are the format's own (``@source: wiki:formats/exe#ps-x-exe-header``): ``pc0`` at
``0x10``, ``t_addr`` at ``0x18`` and ``t_size`` at ``0x1C``, after the
``0x800``-byte header the loader skips. Reading the address at ``0x18`` and
treating the image as starting at ``load address - 0x800`` is the handbook rule,
so the bytes after the header scan exactly like an EMI payload at its own base.
